# Jackie Chan's the Flight of the Dragon

Jackie Chan's the Flight of the Dragon is an old-school flash game created for the Global Gaming Jam 2025. This project was developed in just two days using Python and Pygame, adhering to the theme of "Bubbles." The game draws inspiration from Jackie Chan's iconic stunt, "Flight of the Dragon," performed in the movie *Armour of God*, and the legendary arcade game *Space Invaders*.

## Concept

Jackie must skillfully avoid collisions with carbon dioxide gas clouds and birds while hovering on a balloon. 
The carbon dioxide clouds represent greenhouse gas emissions. The game blends elements of action, strategy, and environmental consciousness into an engaging and challenging experience.
